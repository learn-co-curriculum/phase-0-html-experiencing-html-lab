# Experiencing HTML Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create an ordered HTML list
- Create an unordered HTML list

## Introduction

How do we go about writing text for the web? How is that different from the text
that we write in a text file? We're going to experience for ourselves how these
things are different in this lab.

You don't need any prior knowledge of HTML for this lab. We're going to tell you
what to type. Don't focus on specific commands or taking notes. Everything will
be covered thoroughly later. Instead, the goal of this exercise is to feel the
joy of editing a file and seeing the change "out there."

**NOTE:** We don't expect you to know _markup_, _content_, _source text_, or
_rendered text_ yet. We'll be defining them in this lab.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lesson into your local environment.

**Quick Review:** To fork this lab:

1. click the **Fork** icon in the upper right of this page. This will bring you
   to GitHub. You may be prompted to choose where to fork — choose your personal
   GitHub account.
2. Once your fork is created, click the **Code** button in GitHub, choose
   **SSH** and copy the provided git URL info.

Then, in your terminal:

**3.** Clone to your local machine with `git clone` followed by the git URL you
copied.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/phase-0-html-experiencing-html-lab.git
```

**4.** The previous command will create a folder in the location you're
currently in containing your fork of this lab's repository. `cd` into the
repository that you just cloned down in the terminal, then run `code .` to open
the files in Visual Studio Code.

```console
$ cd phase-0-html-experiencing-html-lab.git
$ code .
```

**5.** Finally, run `npm install` to install the lab's dependencies.

```console
$ npm install
```

## Create an Ordered HTML List

Think of a collection of things united by theme: Pokémon, Old-school MC's, Prime
Ministers of New Zealand, Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them, etc. We're
going to walk through how to create a list of things marked up with HTML.

### Create a Text File with Content

In your terminal, while still inside of this labs directory, create a new file
called `my_list.txt` by running `touch my_list.txt`. The file extension suggests
to humans and operating systems that it contains text. Open the file in VS Code
by typing `code my_list.txt`; you will do all editing for this lesson in VS
Code.

Below is a collection of song titles (songs in the English post-punk genre).
Copy and paste the songs into your `my_list.txt` file.

```text
"Love Will Tear Us Apart"
"Bela Lugosi's Dead"
"A Forest"
"Nine While Nine"
"Girlfriend In a Coma"
```

The material we typed into the file is called the _content_. It's the thing
we're trying to communicate.

### Content as a List in a Text File

A problem with our _content_ is that it doesn't explicitly state anywhere that
it's a list. In the example, we see a list of songs. But a browser doesn't know
what a "list" is.

We need to help the browser **know** what a list is. The secret is to add
"notes" or "breadcrumbs" to the content that tell the browser that it has list
items and that these items "go together" in a list. To add these "notes" we
surround the _content_ with bits of _markup_, with bits of HTML.

We will take the text content from our text file, paste it into a new HTML file
and then we will add _markup_ so that a browser "sees" a list. Let's write an
HTML file!

### Text Inside an HTML File

Now we're going to create an HTML list together.

1. Create a new file called `my_list.html`. You can either do this in the
   terminal and then open it in VS Code, or create the file directly in VS Code.
2. Copy the contents of `my_list.txt` and paste them into `my_list.html`
3. Save the `my_list.html` file
4. Open the `my_list.html` file in the browser. For Mac users, you can do this
   with `open my_list.html`. For Windows users, you can do this in your Ubuntu
   app with `explorer.exe my_list.html`. Make sure you've
   [set Chrome as your default browser](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
5. Hit enter to run the command

Once you've opened the file in the browser, you should see:

![HTML file with non-marked-up content displays on one line](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/intro-the-shell/non_marked_up_list.png)

As noted above, the browser doesn't know that items on new lines means "items in
a list." Browsers ignore when HTML is split onto new lines. We cover why a
little later in this README. Since the browser doesn't know we intend this to be
a list **and** since browsers ignore when _content_ is split onto different
lines, it displays all the _content_ on one line. Not what we wanted.

### A Text Not-Really-A-List Into a Real-HTML-List

**REMEMBER**: This lab will provide you what to type. Subsequent labs will
deeply examine details of HTML markup. However, our goal here is to show how
slight changes to markup can quickly alter the browser's display of content. If
you're fuzzy on a detail that's fine.

#### Marking-Up List Items

OK, we've reached the critical moment. We're going to tell the browser that
these bits of letters represent **list items**. To do so we "wrap" each line
with `<li>` and `</li>`:

```html
<li>"Love Will Tear Us Apart"</li>
<li>"Bela Lugosi's Dead"</li>
<li>"A Forest"</li>
<li>"Nine While Nine"</li>
<li>"Girlfriend In a Coma"</li>
```

Flip back to the **viewing tab** and refresh the page. You should see something
like the following:

![Song list](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/experiencing-html-lab/ul_song_list.png)

**AWESOME**.

In this step we added some HTML _markup_:

- The `<li>` is an HTML **list item** _opening tag_
- The `</li>` is an HTML _closing tag_
- We would call this pair of opening and closing tags a "`li` tag"
- The whole length of text of _opening markup_ plus "wrapped" content plus
  _closing markup_ (`<li>...content...</li>`) is called "an HTML element;" or,
  more exactly, an `li element`

Again, you don't need to memorize these terms yet, but we want to help you
develop an intuition for how these words are used. You will be using these terms
when speaking with other developers and HTML authors.

It may not seem like we did much work, but the idea of a method for "marking up"
_content_ and linking it is the foundation of the web. It's what made Tim
Berners-Lee's reputation. And **you** just experienced Sir Tim's great insight.
**AWESOME**.

Let's work with additional HTML tags to see how we tweak our HTML a bit more.
Let's tell the browser "Hey! These list items, they go together!"

### Indicating that List Items Are Connected

Wrap the entire set of `<li>` items with an `<ol>` and `</ol>` like so:

```html
<ol>
  <li>"Love Will Tear Us Apart"</li>
  <li>"Bela Lugosi's Dead"</li>
  <li>"A Forest"</li>
  <li>"Nine While Nine"</li>
  <li>"Girlfriend In a Coma"</li>
</ol>
```

Save the file and refresh the **viewing tab**. It should display:

![List displayed as an ordered list](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/experiencing-html-lab/ordered_list.png)

We told the browser that this set of list items that we "wrapped" in the
**ordered list** tag go together **as a list**. Because we told the browser that
the list is **ordered** it decided to be helpful and put numbers next to the
list items _for us_.

### Wrapping and Indentation

With all these angle-brackets of _markup_ and _content_ mixed together, HTML
authors like to use indentation to make HTML easier to read. Here's how most
HTML authors would expect our code from the previous section to be arranged:

```html
<ol>
  <li>"Love Will Tear Us Apart"</li>
  <li>"Bela Lugosi's Dead"</li>
  <li>"A Forest"</li>
  <li>"Nine While Nine"</li>
  <li>"Girlfriend In a Coma"</li>
</ol>
```

Update your document. Save it and refresh your **viewing tab**.

Remember earlier when the browser ignored that _content_ was on separate lines?
Cleaning up your code requires splitting lines, adding spaces, and adding tabs.
Browsers ignore those characters that _humans_ use to make their HTML
reader-friendly.

## Create an Unordered HTML List

Let's change our ordered list to be **unordered**. If `<ol>` means **ordered
list**, you might guess that `<ul>` means **unordered list**. Make the change
and refresh your **viewing tab**.

![Back to Unordered List](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/experiencing-html-lab/unordered_list.png)

Here we return to a "bulleted" unordered list.

**ASIDE**: If you've been following along closely, you might be wondering, if we
didn't have a `<ul>` tag around our `<li>` items earlier, how did the browser
know to treat those `<li>` as if they were in a `<ul>`? When browsers detect
problematic HTML they guess! This can lead to some very strange results when you
make an error, but if you write _invalid_ HTML, they try to recover. HTML
validity will be discussed further soon!

### Add a Description Paragraph

Let's introduce our list by adding some background:

```html
<p>Some of my favorite post-punk and Goth songs!</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Love Will Tear Us Apart"</li>
  <li>"Bela Lugosi's Dead"</li>
  <li>"A Forest"</li>
  <li>"Nine While Nine"</li>
  <li>"Girlfriend In a Coma"</li>
</ul>
```

Take a look at your "rendered page" and verify the result is to your liking.

### Put a Header on It

Lastly, let's put a "heading" on the top of our document. Add a `h1` element
with an appropriate title inside.

```html
<h1>My Music List</h1>
```

Here's the full example code:

```html
<h1>My Music List</h1>
<p>Some of my favorite post-punk and Goth songs!</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Love Will Tear Us Apart"</li>
  <li>"Bela Lugosi's Dead"</li>
  <li>"A Forest"</li>
  <li>"Nine While Nine"</li>
  <li>"Girlfriend In a Coma"</li>
</ul>
```

![Final Document](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/experiencing-html-lab/final_header_paragraph_ul.png)

When you're done, it is time to run this assignment's tests. Make sure that you
have your HTML content in a file called `my_list.html` in order to pass the
check. Type `npm test` and verify that your tests pass.

## Saving Your Work Remotely

Currently, the work you've done on this assignment is only on your local
machine. To preserve work on your GitHub fork, you will need to stage the
changes you've made, commit them, and push the commit up to GitHub. Use the
following commands to do this:

```console
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Completed assignment"
$ git push
```

If you visit your fork on GitHub, you should now see that _you've_ made the most
recent commit, and your solution will be present in the files.

Once you've pushed your code to GitHub, do the following steps to submit your
work on Canvas:

1. Go to your repository in GitHub and copy the URL. Note, this should be copied
   from the browser's address bar, and should start with `https://github.com/`

2. Go to the assignment in Canvas and click Submit Assignment (or Start
   Assignment)

3. Paste in your GitHub URL as your submission

## Conclusion

In this lab, you have done the job of an HTML author. You receive raw _content_,
you _mark it up_ to create _source text_. You test, tweak and adjust your
_source text_ until the _rendered text_ displayed in the browser is to your
liking.

In upcoming lessons, we will learn additional tags which provide us more ways to
describe our content. We might be starting with lists today, but soon we'll be
using HTML in even more exciting ways!
